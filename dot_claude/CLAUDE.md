# Personal Preferences

## Shell Commands

Prefer simple, single commands over compound ones. Avoid `&&`, `||`, sub-shells `$(...)`, pipes, and other shell constructs that chain or nest commands — these trigger additional permission prompts. Run each command separately and sequentially instead.

## Commits

When you believe your work is complete and ready for my review, create a git commit automatically. Do not ask for permission first. Use a clear, descriptive commit message that summarizes what was done and why. Follow the conventional commit style of the repository if one exists.

**IMPORTANT: No Attribution**

Do NOT add any attribution to commits. This means:

- No `Co-Authored-By` lines
- No `Signed-off-by` lines
- No mentions of AI, Claude, or any contributor in commit messages
- Just the commit message itself, nothing else
